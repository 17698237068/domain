## Resident identity card {#section_bjz_lh3_wgb .section}

Individual domain holders who use their resident identity card for real-name authentication must enter and submit all required information, as described in the following example:

**Note:** 

-   Chinese persons who are based in mainland China cannot use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process. We recommend that Chinese persons use their resident identity card and foreign residents use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process.
-   You can only use your passport for real-name authentication if you are not based in mainland China.

Follow these guidelines when you enter the information:

1.  Registrant: the name of the domain holder. Keep it consistent with the name on your resident identity card.
2.  Certification number: Enter the resident identity card number.
    -   The certification number must be half-width characters \(in English input mode\).
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted before July 5, 2019, the authentication fails.
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted after July 5, 2019, the application review period will be extended. Alibaba Cloud and the review organization need to communicate and review the application. The time required to review your application will vary depending on the preceding requirements.

            **Note:** We recommend that you use half-width characters when entering the required information for real-name authentication. If you used full-width characters and want to expedite real-name authentication, we recommend that you create a new registrant profile. In the profile, enter the relevant information by using half-width characters and resubmit the real-name authentication request.

    -   Make sure to enter the complete resident identity card number.
3.  Upload real name certification: Upload a scanned copy of your resident identity card.

    **Note:** 

    -   Submit a scanned copy or photo of your identity document. The size of a scanned copy or photo must be 55 KB to 1 MB. Supported file formats include **JPG and BMP**.

        For other formats, use a graphics editor such as Microsoft paint or Adobe Photoshop to convert the file to JPG or BMP format. **Do not directly change the file extension.**

    -   You must submit a complete and clear scanned copy of the identity document with no cover or smudges. Include the borders of the identity document.

## Passport {#section_fln_sy3_wgb .section}

Individual domain holders that use the passport for real-name authentication must enter and submit all required information, as described in the following example:

**Note:** 

-   Chinese natural persons who are based in mainland China cannot use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process. We recommend that Chinese persons use their resident identity card and foreign residents use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process.
-   You can only use your passport for real-name authentication if you are not based in mainland China.

Follow these guidelines when you enter the information:

1.  Registrant: the name of the domain holder. Keep it consistent with the name on your passport. Do not enter abbreviations.

    **Note:** Keep the name of the domain holder consistent with the name on the identity document that you uploaded for authentication. If the identity document is written in English, enter the domain holder name in English in the Registrant field.

2.  Certification number: Enter the complete passport number.
    -   The certification number must be half-width characters \(in English input mode\).
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted before July 5, 2019, the authentication fails.
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted after July 5, 2019, the application review period will be extended. Alibaba Cloud and the review organization need to communicate and review the application. The time required to review your application will vary depending on the preceding requirements.
