## Resident identity card {#section_bjz_lh3_wgb .section}

Individual domain holders that use their resident identity card for real-name authentication must enter and submit all required information to complete the real-name authentication process, as described in the following example:

**Note:** 

-   Chinese natural persons that are based in mainland China cannot use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process. We recommend that Chinese natural persons use their resident identity card and foreign residents use their passport to complete the real-name authentication process.

-   We recommend that you use your passport for real-name authentication if you are not based in mainland China.


Follow these guidelines when you enter the information:

1.  Domain Holder: the name of the domain holder. Keep it consistent with the name on your resident identity card.
2.  Certificate Number: enter the resident identity card number.

    -   Submit a scanned copy or photo of your resident identity card. The size of a scanned copy or photo must be from 55 KB to 1 MB. Supported file formats include **JPG and BMP**.

        For other formats, use a graphics editor such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop to convert them to the JPG or BMP format. **Do not change the file extension directly**.
