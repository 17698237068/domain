# Real-name authentication examples for organization domain holders {#concept_gxx_hf3_wgb .concept}

This topic describes how to enter and submit the required information to complete the real-name authentication process. The following examples apply to organization domain holders.

Organization domain holders can submit a scanned copy of a valid identity document for real-name authentication. Supported identity documents include business licenses, organization code certificates, or other valid certificates with a valid certificate number or code. This topic describes how to use a business license and organization code certificate to enter and submit the required information for real-name authentication.

Domain holders belonging to different regions must use different certificates to complete the real-name authentication process, as described in the following table:

|Region|Certificate type|Description|
|------|----------------|-----------|
|Mainland China regions|[Business license](#section_wsm_jf3_wgb)|Organization domain holders that are based in mainland China can use the business license or organization code certificate for real-name authentication.|
|[Organization code certificate](#section_f4l_xrd_xgb)|
|Non-mainland China regions|[Other valid certificates](#section_jlt_gqz_zgb)|Organization domain holders that are not based in mainland China can use other valid certificates for real-name authentication, such as a certificate of incorporation.|

## Business license {#section_wsm_jf3_wgb .section}

Organization domain holders that use the business license for real-name authentication must enter and submit all required information, as described in the following example:

**Note:** The business license specified in this topic indicates the permit issued by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People's Republic of China. Domain holders that are not based in mainland China use an organization certificate other than a Chinese business license for real-name authentication. These domain holders need to select "others" as the certificate type when configuring an authentication request.

Follow these guidelines when you enter the information:

1.  Registrant: the name of the domain holder. Keep it consistent with the name on your business license.

    **Note:** If the name contains parentheses, use half-width parentheses.

2.  Real name certification type: Select business license.
3.  Certification number: You must enter the unified social credit code that is contained in the business license. However, if the business license does not contain a unified social credit code, enter the registration number on the business license.
    -   The certification number must be half-width characters \(in English input mode\).
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted before July 5, 2019, the authentication fails.
        -   If full-width characters are found in a real-name authentication request submitted after July 5, 2019, the application review period will be extended. Alibaba Cloud and the review organization need to communicate and review the application. The time required to review your application will vary depending on the preceding requirements.

            **Note:** We recommend that you use half-width characters when entering the required information for real-name authentication. If you used full-width characters and want to expedite real-name authentication, we recommend that you create a new registrant profile. In the profile, enter the relevant information by using half-width characters and resubmit the real-name authentication request.

    -   If the business license contains a duplicate number, such as \(1-1\), do not enter the duplicate number.
    -   Make sure that you distinguish between number "0" and letter "O", number "1"and letter "I", and number "8" and letter "B".
    -   You must be sure to enter the complete certificate number or code.
4.  Upload real name certification: Upload a scanned copy of the business license.

    Submit a scanned copy of the business license. Make sure that the copy includes all required information. If you use the business license, scan all information contained in the license, including the national emblem and the seal affixed by the authority that manages the business license.

    **Note:** 

    -   You can upload a scanned copy of the original business license or a license duplicate.
    -   Submit a scanned copy or photo of your business license. The size of a scanned copy or photo must be 55 KB to 1 MB. Supported file formats include JPG and BMP.

        For other formats, use a graphics editor such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Photoshop to convert the file to JPG or BMP format. **Do not directly change the file extension.**

    -   You must submit a complete and clear scanned copy of the license with no cover or smudges. Include the borders of the license, the national emblem, and the seal affixed by the authority that manages the business license.
5.  Issue date.
    -   It requires a minimum of 10 days for the verification authority to issue a new license. We recommend that you implement real-name authentication after you receive your license.

    -   We recommend you check that your business license is still valid before proceeding.

        **Note:** Real-name authentication may fail if your business license is due to expire.
