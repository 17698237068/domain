# Information required for real-name authentication {#concept_bsp_kyv_12b .concept}

According to the regulations issued by the China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\), all domain name holders must submit real, accurate, and complete information of registered domain names. Otherwise, the domain name will be canceled. Therefore, you must submit the required information and complete the real-name authentication process after you register a .cn domain name. The authentication process includes the real-name authentication of the domain holder and the verification of the registered domain name.

## Individual holders {#section_djm_2ff_chb .section}

Individual domain name holders must submit a scanned copy or high-definition photo of their valid passport. Non-mainland China residents who do have a passport can submit a copy of their driver's license.

Mainland China residents must submit a copy of their resident identity card. The holder of the domain name and the owner of the identity document must be the same.

**Note:** 

-   You must submit a complete and clear scanned copy of the identity document with no covering or smudges. Make sure that the identify document has its borders included. The size of a scanned copy must be from 55 KB to 1 MB. Supported photo formats include JPG and BMP.
