# Enable the transfer prohibition lock {#concept_ztt_zv1_b2b .concept}

## Introduction {#section_dxt_fw1_b2b .section}

The transfer prohibition lock is a value-added domain name service that prevents unauthorized outbound domain name transfers. After the service is enabled, your domain name is put in the clientTransferProhibited status.

Because available domain name resources are getting increasingly scarce and the prices for premium domain names continue to soar, domain hijacking and other malicious activity is a serious concern and liability for businesses. It is therefore imperative that domain names are protected. This service effectively prevents domain names from being transferred from Alibaba Cloud and domain name registrant information from being modified without authorization. We recommend that you use this service to ensure your business security.
