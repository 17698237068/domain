# What is a domain name {#concept_vpf_cbd_b2b .concept}

A domain name is your website name. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of numbers.Â  However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net, and so on. A domain name must be registered before you can use it. Each domain name is unique.
