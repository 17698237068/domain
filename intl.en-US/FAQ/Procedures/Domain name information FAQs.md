## Must I provide genuine information during domain registration? {#section_b1k_ttd_b2b .section}

## Why can’t I find my domain name in the Domain Name list? {#section_d1k_ttd_b2b .section}

Possible causes and corresponding solutions are as follows:

-   You have more than one Alibaba Cloud account, and your domain name was not registered with the account that is currently logged on.
-   You have missed the renewal/redemption period for your domain name, and it has already been removed. You can use [Alibaba Cloud WHOIS search](https://www.alibabacloud.com/whois) page to view the domain name status. If the status is Not Registered, you can register this domain name again. If your domain name has been registered by another person or entity, you have to negotiate with the registrant to see if the registrant would like to transfer the domain name to you.
-   You have just completed the registration process and made the payment, but the domain name is not added to the Domain Name list.
    -   That is because your account has outstanding payment, and the payment you just made has been used to offset the outstanding payment, causing failure to purchase the domain name. You can try to purchase this domain name again.
    -   The domain name you attempted to register is subject to trademark protection or is a premium domain name. Alibaba Cloud will inform you of the registration failure and refund the payment you’ve made to your Alibaba Cloud account.
