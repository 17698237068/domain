# Types of top-level domain names {#concept_hsw_nbd_b2b .concept}

Top-level domain names \(TLDs\) include generic top-level domain names and country code top-level domain names.

-   Generic top-level domain names \(gTLDs\) are most widely used domain names. For example, .com is mainly used by commercial entities, .net is originally used by network infrastructures, and .org is originally used by nonprofit organizations.
-   Country code top-level domain names \(ccTLDs\) are domain names assigned to different countries/regions. For example, .cn indicates China, .us indicates the United States, .jp indicates Japan, and so on.

Now, there are more than 270 TLDs.

-   Unsponsored gTLDs include: .com, .net, .org, .int, .arpa, .biz, .info, .name, and .pro. Unsponsored gTLDs are subject to fewer restrictions upon registration than sponsored gTLDs.  
-   Sponsored gTLDs include: edu, .gov, .mil, .aero, .cooper, .museum, .jobs, .mobi, .travel, .tel, .cat, and .asia. A sponsored TLD is a specialized top-level domain that has a sponsor representing a specific community served by the domain.
-   TLDs with two characters \(such as .uk and .de\) match with official initials for over 250 countries and regions.  These domain names are called country-code domain names \(ccTLDs\). Each ccTLD has a registration operator that operates ccTLDs in accordance with the local policies.
