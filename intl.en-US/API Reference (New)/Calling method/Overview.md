# Overview {#concept_pys_gjb_b2b .concept}

To call a domain name API, the caller must send an HTTP POST or GET request to the domain name API server and add relevant request parameters in the request according to the API instructions. The system returns corresponding results for processing the request.

For more information about how to call an API, see the following documents.

-   [Request structure](reseller.en-US/API Reference (New)/Calling method/Request structure.md#)
-   [Public parameters](reseller.en-US/API Reference (New)/Calling method/Public parameters.md#)
-   [Returned results](reseller.en-US/API Reference (New)/Calling method/Returned results.md#)
-   [Signature](reseller.en-US/API Reference (New)/Calling method/Signature.md#)

**Note:** We recommend that you use SDK to manage your resources or call interfaces. It is easier for you to get started by using the language-specific SDK instead of adding signature in each request.
