# Register a domain name {#concept_x22_3rv_12b .concept}

This topic describes how to register a generic domain name that uses a generic top-level domain, such as .com and .cn on Alibaba Cloud. After you have registered a domain name, complete the real-name authentication process for the domain name as soon as possible.

## The following procedure shows how to purchase a domain name. {#section_w1w_krv_12b .section}

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domain website](https://www.alibabacloud.com/domain). If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, register one first.
2.  Enter a domain name and click **Find A Domain**.
3.  Select a domain name from the search results and click **Add to cart**.
4.  Select the domain name in **Shopping Cart** and click **Buy Now**
5.  On the **Confirm Order** page, click **Place Order**.
6.  Make sure that the domain information is correct and click **Pay**.

If the domain name that you want to register has already been registered, alternatives are available. For example, if the domain name forexample.com has already been registered, you can choose a domain name that uses another top-level domain, such as forexample.net, forexample.info, or forexample.xin.

The processes for registering a premium domain name and a generic domain name are similar. To register a premium domain name, follow the registration procedure described in this topic.

## Real-name authentication {#section_wm2_rwg_ygb .section}

If the domain name that you have registered uses the .cn top-level domain, you must complete the real-name authentication process for the domain name. Otherwise, your domain name will become inaccessible. For more information, see [Real-name authentication for .cn domains](../../../../../intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains /Real-name authentication for .cn domains.md#section_qyn_s41_ygb).
