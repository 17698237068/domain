# Naming rules for domain names {#concept_n3v_2pv_12b .concept}

Domain names with different suffixes may have different naming rules. You must follow the corresponding domain name naming rules to register a domain name. This topic describes the naming rules for Chinese and English domains and other special domains. You can study the corresponding rules based on your business requirements and select your domain name.

## Naming rules for Chinese domain names {#section_et3_3pv_12b .section}

A Chinese domain name must comply to the following rules:

-   The domain name must contain one Chinese character and can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\).
-   The domain name can be registered in simplified or traditional Chinese. For most domain name registrars, a domain name in simplified Chinese is equivalent to its traditional Chinese form. However, if a domain name is registered in simplified Chinese, the equivalent domain name in traditional Chinese can no longer be registered. The converse operation also applies.
-   The domain name cannot start or end with a hyphen \(-\), plus sign \(+\), at sign \(@\), ampersand \(&\), or space.
-   The domain name cannot only contain letters or digits.
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.
-   The Punycode for the domain name cannot exceed 63 characters in length.
-   Some domain names cannot contain Chinese characters, such as .com.cn, .net.cn, and .org.cn domains.

## Naming rules for English domain names {#section_ghs_lpv_12b .section}

An English domain name must comply to the following rules:

-   The domain name can contain English letters \(A to Z, case-insensitive\), digits \(0 to 9\), and hyphens \(-\). It cannot contain spaces and special characters, such as exclamation point \(!\), dollar sign \($\), ampersand \(&\), and question mark \(?\). \[DO NOT TRANSLATE\]
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.
-   The domain name cannot exceed 63 characters in length.

## Naming rules for .中国, .cn, .公司, and .网络 domain names {#section_uk1_5qv_12b .section}

The China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\) stipulates that:

If the word "中国", "国家", "中华", or "全国" is used in a .中国, .cn, .公司, or .网络 domain name, the registration of the domain name must be applied for by the trademark holder. Individuals or non-trademark holder organizations cannot apply to register the domain name without prior authorization.

For example, the registration of domain "中国律师协会.中国" can only be applied for by the corresponding trademark holder, the China Lawyers Association. This association must submit real-name authentication materials within five days after successful registration and pass the CNNIC qualification review of the entity organization before using the domain name. The domain name will be deleted if the application submitted by the individual or non-trademark holder does not pass the review conducted by the CNNIC qualification authority.
