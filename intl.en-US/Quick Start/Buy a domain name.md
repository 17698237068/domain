# Buy a domain name {#concept_x22_3rv_12b .concept}

## The following steps detail how to buy a domain name:Â  {#section_w1w_krv_12b .section}

1.  Log on to Alibaba Cloud domain. If you have no Alibaba Cloud account, apply for one.
2.  Enter the domain name you want in the search box and click **Find A Domain**.
3.  Select the domain name you want from the search results, and click **Add to cart**.
4.  On the **Shopping cart** page, click**Buy Now**.
5.  On the **Confirm Order** page, click **Place Order**.
6.  On the Pay page, click **Pay**.

If the domain name you want is already registered, alternatives that have not already been registered may be available. For example, if the .com domain for www.justanexample.com is already registered, you can select another available domain such as .info and create www.justanexample.info instead.

Registering a premium domain name is the same procedure as registering an ordinary domain name, which means you can follow these steps as required.
