# Rules for registering a domain name {#concept_n3v_2pv_12b .concept}

You must follow the rules for registering a domain name.

## For a Chinese domain name {#section_et3_3pv_12b .section}

The following rules apply when registering a Chinese domain name:

-   The domain name must contain at least one Chinese character and may contain English letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\). It cannot consist of only English letters or digits.

-   The domain name can be registered in simplified Chinese or traditional Chinese. If a domain name is registered in simplified Chinese, the equivalent domain name in traditional Chinese can no longer be registered. The converse operation also applies. This is designed to protect brandsâ€™ domain names.

-   Illegal characters can not be found at the end of the first row, such as: two-character \(-\), plus sign \(+\), \(@\), \(&\), spaces, etc;

-   A Chinese domain name cannot contain only digits or only letters.


## For an English domain name {#section_ghs_lpv_12b .section}

The following rules apply when registering an English domain name:

-   Only English letters \(a-z; case-insensitive\), digits \(0-9\), and hyphens \(-\) are supported. Spaces and special characters \(such as !, $, &, and ?\) are not supported.

-   The domain name cannot start or end with a hyphen \(-\), or use a hyphen \(-\) as the third or fourth character.

-   The domain name can be up to 63 characters in length.
