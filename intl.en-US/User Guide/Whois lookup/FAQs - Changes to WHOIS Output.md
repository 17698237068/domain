# FAQs - Changes to WHOIS Output {#concept_hp2_tdw_12b .concept}

## Q: Why changing the public WHOIS output? {#section_n1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: On 17 May 2018 ICANN announced the Temporary Specification for gTLD Registration Data in light of the upcoming European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\).  According to this temporary policy, Registry operators and Registrars are required to mask/hide personal data in public WHOIS output.

## Q: What are the changes in public WHOIS output? {#section_o1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: As mandated by ICANN’s temporary policy, Alibaba Cloud registrar will no longer display personal data in WHOIS output, including Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact’s Name, Email, Phone and Address.

## Q: Is domain registration process or requirement being changed as well? {#section_p1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: No. The changes are only made to public WHOIS output. Collection of data and our domain registration process remain unchanged.

## Q: Any influence on the process of domain transfer \(change of registrar\)? {#section_q1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: As public WHOIS output may no longer display Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact’s email addresses, ICANN’s transfer policy will be changed, namely:

1.  The Gaining Registrar is not required to obtain a Form of Authorization from the Transfer Contact.
2.  The Registrant must independently re-enter Registration Data with the Gaining Registrar. In such instance, the Gaining Registrar is not required to follow the Change of Registrant Process as provided in Section II.C. of the transfer policy.

## Q: How can I get in touch with a Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact? {#section_s1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: If you would like to contact the registrant, admin contact or tech contact of a domain name sponsored by our registrar, you will need to fill out the web-form request on our WHOIS output page. Your message will be forwarded to the contact specified in the web-form.

## Q: Can I ask for access to non-public WHOIS data? How? {#section_t1q_xmx_12b .section}

## Is this change to public WHOIS output permanent? {#section_v1q_xmx_12b .section}

A: The maximum duration of this ICANN temporary policy is 12 months, but during which time ICANN may change the implementation details of the policy. As the organization responsible for DNS system, root name servers and oversee gTLD domain registrars and registries, ICANN is in the process of finalizing a long term GDPR-compliant WHOIS system.  Therefore, as an ICANN-accredited registrar we may have to make further changes to our WHOIS output and systems based on ICANN’s temporary policy revision, new consensus policy or applicable law in due course.
