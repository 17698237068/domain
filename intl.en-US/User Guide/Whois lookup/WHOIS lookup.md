# WHOIS lookup {#concept_lnn_clx_12b .concept}

WHOIS lookup is generally used to discover the registration information of a domain, including its registrar \(such as Alibaba Cloud\), the status of the domain name, and other important dates \(such as the domain name registration date and expiration date\). Network administrators can use WHOIS data to identify and confirm problems.
