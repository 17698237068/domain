# Overview {#concept_vb1_11c_n2b .concept}

This document briefly introduces Resource Access Management \(RAM\) for domain name resources. If you do not need RAM, skip this section.

After you activate Alibaba Cloud domain name service, you have full permission to do operations on your Alibaba Cloud account resources by default. By enabling the RAM service, you can grant permissions for accessing and managing domain name resources under the Alibaba Cloud account to RAM users, that is, subusers.
