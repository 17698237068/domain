# Reclaim your domain name {#concept_yyl_11b_b2b .concept}

A domain name can only be used by one Alibaba Cloud account. If your domain name has been used by another Alibaba Cloud account, you must reclaim it first so that you can add it to your DNS list. Follow these steps to reclaim a domain name:

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domain console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/domain), and click **Go to Alibaba Cloud DNS product list** on the top of the page.
2.  Click **Add Domain Name** on the DNS list page.
3.  Enter your domain name. If this domain name has been used by another Alibaba Cloud account, you will receive a prompt. Click **Retrieve Domain Name** in the prompt message.
4.  Verify the ownership of the domain name through **TXT Record Verification**.

    1.  Add the specified TXT record for this domain name at its current DNS service provider.
    2.  After adding the TXT record, click **Verify**.
    Once the verification is successful, you will receive an email.
