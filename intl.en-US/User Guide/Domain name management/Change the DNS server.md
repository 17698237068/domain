# Change the DNS server {#concept_x3z_qvw_12b .concept}

If a domain name is registered at Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Cloudâ€™s DNS servers are used by default.

For example:

dns1.hichina.com

dns2.hichina.com

If you have your own DNS server, or use a third-party DNS server, you can change the DNS server so that the domain can use those instead.

To change the DNS server, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com).
2.  Locate the domain name whose DNS you want to change, and then click **Manage** in the **Action** column.
3.  On the **Basic Information** page, click **DNS Modification** from the left-side navigation pane.
4.  Click **Change DNS**.
5.  Enter the new DNS information, and click **OK**.

**Note:** After the DNS server is changed, it may take up to 48 hours for the change in DNS resolution to take effect.
