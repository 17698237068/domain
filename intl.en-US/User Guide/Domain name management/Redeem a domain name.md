## Redemption description {#section_hvj_tzw_12b .section}

Generally, you have a 30-day renewal period after your domain name expires at Alibaba Cloud. If the domain name is not renewed within the renewal period, the domain name enters into the redemption period. You must then pay a higher price in the redemption period if you want to restore the domain name.

## Procedure {#section_ezd_vzw_12b .section}

To redeem your domain name, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c1d.8251217.1002.19.7e29eef51CoVFy#/domain/list).
2.  Click **To Be Redeemed** and locate the domain name to be redeemed.
3.  Click **Redeem**.
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to submit your redemption request and complete any other redemption steps required.

To make sure that your domain name can be used properly, renew your domain name before it expires. This prevents you from having to pay extra for redemption. For more information, see [How to renew a domain name](intl.en-US/User Guide/Domain name management/Renew a domain name.md#).
